Installation:
=============
Debian sid:
  # apt-get install libprotobuf-c0-dev protobuf-c-compiler libprotobuf6
  $ git clone http://github.com/scrosby/OSM-binary.git
  $ vi Makefile 
    ... adjust the OSM_BINARY_PATH to your local directory
  $ make
It will probably also work with squeeze's libprotobuf-c0, but that's
untested
